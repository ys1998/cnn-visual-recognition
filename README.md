# CS231n 
## [Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition]
This repository contains the solutions to assignments for CS231n offered by Stanford University.

### Assignment 1
Implemented and applied several classifiers such as kNN, multiclass SVM, softmax and two-layer vanilla neural network to CIFAR-10 dataset with appropriate loss functions such as hinge-loss, squared-hinge-loss and multiclass cross-entropy loss. SGD has been used for optimization, along with L2 regularization in all cases.
