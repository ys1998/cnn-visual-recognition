# Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
This repository contains the solutions to assignments for [CS231n](https://cs231n.github.io) offered by Stanford University.

## Assignment 1
Implemented and applied several classifiers such as *kNN* (using Euclidean distances), *linear SVM*, *softmax* and *two-layer vanilla neural network* to **CIFAR-10** dataset with appropriate loss functions such as *hinge-loss* and *cross-entropy* loss. *SGD* has been used for optimization, along with *L2 regularization* in all cases. Improvements gained by using *higher-level representations* (or "features") instead of raw pixel values are also examined.
