# Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
This repository contains the solutions to assignments for [CS231n](https://cs231n.github.io) offered by Stanford University.

## Assignment 1
Implemented and applied several classifiers such as kNN (using both Manhattan and Euclidean distances), multiclass SVM, softmax and two-layer vanilla neural network to CIFAR-10 dataset with appropriate loss functions such as hinge-loss, squared-hinge-loss and multiclass cross-entropy loss. SGD has been used for optimization, along with L2 regularization in all cases. Improvements gained by using higher-level representations instead of raw pixel values are also examined.
